# Heart-Attack-Prediction-
A Machine Learning model which performs classification and predicts the probability of having a heart attack 
A classifcation based ML model which predicts whether you are at hugh risk of having a heart attack
Various classification models have been employed
K-Fold cross validation has been used to identify the best algorithm for the given problem
Data pipelines have been used to scaled , transform data and implement the necessary algorithms
Various Evaluation metrics have been used to measure the accuracy of the model
